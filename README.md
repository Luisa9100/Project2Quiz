#Deployment

This website was creating using visual studio code programming and then uploaded to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
